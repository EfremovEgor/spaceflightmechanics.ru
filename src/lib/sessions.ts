		abstract:
			"Space dangers and threats are the reality of our world. Some of them  already manifested in practical life. Тhe problems of space debris, space weather, asteroid-comet hazard (ACH), the problem of dark and quiet skies have a global nature and are subject of international cooperation. Solving these problems is an essential and necessary component of the work to achieve sustainable development. These issues are regularly discussed both at scientific conferences and at the highest level, for example, at meetings of the UN Scientific and Technical Subcommittee. In this talk we discuss urgent issue of the ACH problem. This is essentially a problem of detection of decameter size Near Earth Asteroids (NEAs), which are the most dangerous on a practically significant time scale. The problem is very far from being solved. This requires the combined efforts of many countries. The report describes the progress and challenges of cooperation between the BRICS and other countries in creating a global effective network for the detection and warning of dangerous asteroids. To detect decameter size NEAs is necessary to regurarly perform a sufficiently deep survey of the entire celestial sphere on a scale of several hours. This requires a sufficiently dense and geographically evenly (globally) distributed network of observation stations. The BRICS approach to creating such a network, based on the BITDN/GOTTA initiative, is  discussed.",

		name: "Interstellar Journeys: Will Ever Become Possible or Are Just a Science Fiction Topic?",
		speaker: "Giancarlo Genta, Polytechnic University of Turin, Italy",
		abstract:
			"Since the first discovery of an exoplanet we realised that planets orbiting other stars are not just an assumption with little scientific ground – and a commonplace of science fiction – but a common occurrence. After more than 20 years we know that terrestrial planets are common and many lie within their star's habitable zone.  In the next years, we expect to start the process leading us to become a multi-planetary species, by first exploring and then colonising the Moon and Mars and other bodies of the solar system. We will launch precursor interstellar probes and likely also true interstellar robotic microprobes performing a fast flyby mission. All this requires just moderate and predictable technological advances and is a required step toward human interstellar exploration and colonisation. But to travel to the stars, and above all to their planetary systems, and to colonize exoplanets will ever be possible? Can we perform true interstellar human missions of the simplest type – either space arks or slow interstellar ships carrying a hibernated crew – in a predictable timeframe? In both cases a nuclear propulsion system – either an advanced fission or a fusion thruster is needed, and this does not require advances in basic science, but only the development of technologies already under study. The study concentrates on the design of what is usually referred to as a ‘slow boat’, i.e., an ark of small size travelling at a small percentage of the speed of light, to reach the extrasolar planet Proxima Centauri b in less than 450 years. The habitat – assumed to be similar to a space settlement of a relatively small size – and the thruster are mainly considered since these elements are believed to be the most critical ones to assess the feasibility of such an interstellar exploration and colonisation mission.",

		name: "The Policy and Legal Roadmap for Competitive and Sovereign Space Markets in the 2030s",
		speaker:
			"Narkhanim Orujova, Space Agency of the Republic of Azerbaijan (Azercosmos), Azerbaijan",
		abstract:
			"This highlight lecture addresses a central paradox facing emerging space nations: how to achieve full technological sovereignty while simultaneously capturing substantial share in the projected $1.4 trillion space economy of the 2040s under the constraints of the 1967 Outer Space Treaty regime. The study employs a mixed comparative and case-study approach. It first identifies four critical global governance gaps (liability scaling, space resource utilization, exhausted ITU coordination, and outdated export-control regimes) through analysis of UN COPUOS, ITU-R, and national legislation records (2020–2025). Azerbaijan is then examined as an instrumental case of deliberate policy sequencing from 2013–2025, combining quantitative commercial performance data (100 % positive cash-flow operations of Azerspace/Azersky) with qualitative policy tracing of legal, financial, and diplomatic decisions. The Azerbaijan model demonstrates that emerging nations can reach commercial profitability, strategic autonomy, and global influence within one decade without perpetual subsidies. Independent 2025 economic modelling shows that closing the identified governance gaps via five proposed instruments (National Space Acts 2.0 with reciprocity clauses, plurilateral sovereign-commercial accords, an international remediation fund, blockchain transparency, and reformed ITU rules) would accelerate global space GDP by an additional 18–22 % by 2035 and reduce catastrophic collision risk by >70 %. Technological sovereignty and commercial competitiveness are not trade-offs but mutually reinforcing outcomes when governance is forward-leaning. The decisive implementation window is 2026–2030. Nations adopting this framework early capture 2-3x higher market share, confirming that deliberate institutional design remains the primary determinant of success in the New Space era. The Azerbaijani playbook offers a replicable roadmap for all middle-income spacefaring states.",

We briefly discuss AI blocks for Space Engineering, which include: (i) AI for movement – AI Move, (ii) AI Tasks such as recorder, etc., and (iii) AI for Combat. We cover some details of AI for combat, specially in two domains, namely, (a) defensive AI for combat, and, (b) offensive AI for combat. To emphasize the applications for the above tasks for the use of AI Computing techniques, we briefly introduce the development of Deep learning. We start with the historical perspective of  a chess game, based on technology called “deep blue” that defeated the then world champion, Garry Kasparov. The advances as reported in the last decade in the journal “Science” popularized neural network based “deep learning”, with large number of successful applications.  These models can be used in the AI models for space engineering. However, these models have limitations, and researchers developed “adversaries” for these models.  We give some simple examples of the same.  Briefly, we comment that, in current electronic warfare, such technologies have strategic contributions.",

		name: "Filling critical environmental data gaps over the Tropics with the 'Equatorial Sentinels for Environment' remote sensing constellation: From classical North-South cooperation paradigm to disruptive South-South and South-North cooperations",
		speaker: "Erick Lansard, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore",
		abstract:
			"“Equatorial Sentinels for Environment” is an innovative distributed satellite system mission concept elaborated at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore that i) is taking full benefit of Near-Equatorial Orbits to create missions with high revisit time - at the expense of coverage of northern latitudes – ii) is proposing low performance sensors that can be cross-calibrated with high performance sensors in polar orbits and iii) is proposing an open platform for innovative and disruptive space cooperations between Southern and Northern countries. For countries in the tropics this trade-off has no downside and enables regional science missions for fractions of the cost of what it takes to have global coverage. Polar orbits provide coverage of northern latitudes at the expense of equatorial revisit times more than 10x longer than equatorial orbits.  “Equatorial Sentinels” present a new revolution in remote sensing by drastically increasing revisit times over the Tropics. These mission concepts can revolutionize Earth Observation systems since they can fill critical data gaps, complementing and enhancing existing systems, yet they also minimize the overall mass in orbit and the number of launches in a sustainable way for a greener planet. Selected use cases will illustrate the power of the proposed mission design concepts. Applications for “Equatorial Sentinels” with small or very small satellites include climate change and geohazard monitoring, among many other Earth Observation use cases. This innovative architecture is also offering a quite unique geopolitical collaboration frame between countries in an innovative and disruptive South-South and South-North collaborative frameworks, transcending traditional North-South frameworks where the Northern countries used to help the Southern countries.",

		speaker: "Andrey Klimov, Astronomical Research Center, Russia",
		abstract:
			"The Low Earth Orbit (LEO) environment is approaching a critical saturation point due to exponential growth in satellite deployments and space debris. Traditional Space Situational Awareness (SSA) systems—reliant on costly radars and misallocated optical assets—are insufficient to detect the most hazardous population: debris (1–10 cm). This  proposes a tiered, optical-first SSA architecture as the foundation for sustainable LEO operations. It proposes the use of specialized telescopes: ultra-wide-field systems for large debris surveys, distributed barrier telescope networks for LEO monitoring, and high-sensitivity apertures reserved for faint or high-altitude objects. ANC JSC’s solution—based on an automated network of barrier telescopes and ultra-wide-field telescopes  employing motion-compensated frame stacking—demonstrates scalable, cost-effective detection of LEO objects. By aligning sensor capabilities with mission-specific needs and promoting open data cooperation, this approach enables resilient, anti-fragile SSA essential for global space safety in the 2025–2030 timeframe and beyond.",

		abstract:
			"India’s geospatial and space sectors are undergoing a major transformation. This change is fueled by new policies, fast-moving technology, and growing private-sector involvement. The National Geospatial Policy and the Indian Space Policy have created a more open and innovative framework that places India among the global leaders modernizing their spatial data systems. These reforms have sped up commercialization, allowed full private participation in satellite manufacturing and launch services, and increased access to geospatial data. By supporting start-up innovation, strengthening partnerships between academia and industry, and developing a skilled workforce, India is creating a strong and sustainable geospatial and space ecosystem. This combined policy approach not only improves data sovereignty and strategic independence but also positions the country as a global center for commercial space services, geospatial intelligence, and the development of new space technologies. Initiatives driven by policy, like creating high-resolution digital elevation models and implementing digital twin systems in major cities, are enhancing the national geospatial infrastructure, which is currently valued at USD 4.5 billion. India’s space economy has seen impressive growth due to the opening up of satellite manufacturing, the expansion of space-based applications, and improvements in supporting infrastructure. As a result, the Indian space economy, now estimated at about USD 8.4 billion, is expected to reach USD 40 billion by 2040. There is an optimistic outlook that it could even grow to USD 100 billion, driven by increased satellite services, small-satellite production, private launch capabilities, and a rapidly expanding market for geospatial information.",

			"India's space sector has undergone transformative reforms driven by the global evolution from Space 1.0 (government-led programs of the 1950s-70s) to Space 4.0 (democratized, commercially-driven ecosystem of 2010s-present). This paradigm shift, characterized by technological democratization, data monetization, and venture capital investment, has necessitated fundamental restructuring of India's traditionally government dominated space activities to harness commercial opportunities in the global space economy. In 2020, India announced comprehensive space sector reforms establishing three institutional pillars: IN-SPACe (Indian National Space Promotion and Authorization Centre) as the autonomous nodal agency for private space activities, NSIL (NewSpace India Limited) as the commercial arm, and repositioned ISRO for advanced research and technology transfer. IN-SPACe operates under a decadal vision to grow India's space economy from $8.4 billion (2022) to $44 billion by 2033, capturing 8% of the global market. IN-SPACe has implemented various schemes across the space value chain including: Venture Capital Fund, Technology Adoption Fund, Seed Fund Scheme, SSLV technology transfer, Ground Segment as a Service (GSaaS), Earth Observation Public-Private Partnership (EO-PPP), Satellite Bus as a Service (SBaaS), Pre-Incubation Entrepreneurship (PIE) program, investment incentives, ITU filing support, FDI policies, and technical facility access etc. Multiple Indian states have developed supportive space policies and manufacturing clusters. The reforms have generated remarkable private sector response with over 330 companies now associated with IN-SPACe, successful technology transfers, and emergence of prominent startups in the upstream, midstream, and downstream segments. The reforms have positioned India to leverage its cost advantages and technical capabilities in the Space 4.0 era, with potential to create hundreds of thousands of jobs and contribute significantly to GDP growth. While challenges remain in regulatory complexity, infrastructure gaps, and skill development, the comprehensive institutional framework and growing ecosystem participation demonstrate India's commitment to becoming a leading space nation.

		abstract:
			"Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) faces unique development challenges, including limited infrastructure, widespread poverty, food security issues, and vulnerability to climate change impacts. Satellite technology offers transformative opportunities to address these issues by providing essential data and connectivity across vast, remote, and underserved regions where terrestrial infrastructure is prohibitively expensive to deploy. The paper argues that despite a growing number of African countries launching their own satellites and increasing investment in the sector, significant barriers remain, including a lack of technical expertise, high service costs, and inadequate regulatory frameworks. Key strategies to unlock this potential include training and capacity building and regional and international cooperation. Developing local human capital through targeted education, training programs, and the establishment of indigenous space capabilities (e.g., small satellite programs and ground facilities) is essential. This fosters the technical know-how to process and analyze satellite data for informed decision-making in sectors like agriculture, healthcare, and disaster management. Collaborative efforts among African nations can optimize resource allocation and avoid duplication of efforts. Initiatives like the African Space Agency (AfSA) and continental data infrastructure platforms such as Digital Earth Africa (DE Africa) facilitate the sharing of data, infrastructure, and expertise for common benefit. Partnerships with established global space agencies and commercial entities are vital for technology transfer, know-how sharing, and access to global markets and advanced capabilities. These collaborations can help bridge technological gaps and ensure the sustainability of African space programs. In conclusion, a concerted effort in strategic capacity building and robust regional and international cooperation is imperative for SSA to effectively leverage satellite technology, bridge the digital divide, and accelerate progress towards its Sustainable Development Goals and the African Union's Agenda 2063.",

		abstract:
			"Air-intake duct is an important component of air-breathing propulsion system for high-speed vehicles. The performance of this component including supply of air with good quality and accurate quantity is vital to the overall success of engine at various operating conditions. Intake flow field is complex due to the involvement of several shock waves with its reflection and the growing boundary layer inside the duct. At subcritical state of intake operation, the interaction between multiple shock waves and the boundary layer makes the flow difficult to manage, leading to instabilities called as buzz. Plasma actuation during buzz at the site ahead of such interactions could be a possible way to subside the impact of such violent interactions, and the studies of such concept are limited in open literature. Experiments and computations have been carried out to obtain and demonstrate the buzz at freestream Mach number of 2.0.  The characteristics of buzz have been studied with different throttling ratios to quantify certain influencing parameters impacting buzz. Dielectric Barrier Discharge type of plasma actuation has been numerically simulated on the surface of intake spike. This has been done using a user defined function integrated with Ansys Fluent by adding body force as source term to the momentum equation. Plasma actuation infuse reenergisation of the boundary layer affecting the interaction of shock with the boundary layer. Experimental observations with different throttling ratios indicate violent to and fro motion of conical shock on the spike of the intake with various frequencies. These self-sustaining oscillations are like shock buffeting on surfaces of space vehicles and could be generated even due to inevitable mounts on the vehicle surface exposed to high-speed flows. Another such problem which the authors envisage is the launch vehicles blunt nose tip with spike. Such oscillations need to be contained and in the present investigation, the plasma generation through numerical modelling on a portion of spike of the intake with plasma power density of 21 MW/m2, indicates to have a complete halt of such shock movement on the spike and thus stops the buzz phenomena. Shock buffeting similar to buzz is a typical problem which exists in many other aerospace problems where shock boundary layer interactions are common. This type of problems could very well be addressed using this present concept and technique.",

		abstract:
			"The mineral and combined functions of materials with remarkable mechanical, thermal, and electromagnetic qualities have primarily been the driving force behind the development of new satellite systems and spacecrafts. Nevertheless, the high-end characteristics required by the latest technological sectors, such as reduced weight, better radiation resistance, thermal cycling tolerance, and electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding, cannot, at the moment, be met by the existing materials like aluminium alloys, carbon-epoxy laminate, and polyimide-based films, which have been in use for a long time. This article presents a hybrid carbon composite that addresses these problems; it is a composite of graphite nanoflakes and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) synthesised in a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) matrix, which can be easily used in space as a lightweight, multifunctional material system. In the present work, a low-cost maintenance approach is proposed as the primary method for converting the PVDF matrix into a medium for one-dimensional MWCNTs and two-dimensional graphite parallel dispersion. The graphite filler primarily contributes to the material's properties of high thermal conductivity, structural rigidity, and low EMI attenuation. MWCNTs facilitate crack deflection pathways, electrical conductivity, and stress transmission. Furthermore, a thorough material characterization is conducted with advanced characterisation techniques such as XRD, FTIR, FESEM, TGA and EDS to assess interfacial interactions, chemical compatibility, filler dispersion, and structural integrity. To ascertain the composite's suitability for aerospace applications, it has undergone extensive testing through space-qualification experiments that highlight its performance-critical aspects, such as thermal cycling, vacuum outgassing, dielectric behavior, and EMI shielding tests. The said innovation becomes a strong option for aerospace subsystems like satellite structural skins, antenna housings, and solar panels. The present research foresees the scientific advancement of carbon-based polymer nanocomposites as possible space-grade materials.",

			"Space technical policy and law at the international level originated in resolutions of general principles adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in the early 1960’s. These initial statements consisted of a handful of principles considered to be essential for the peaceful movement of mankind into outer space, including activities on the Moon and other celestial bodies. Within a few years these resolutions were incorporated and elaborated upon in the Outer Space Treaty of 1967, followed by the Rescue and Return Agreement, the Liability Convention, and the Registration Convention, all of which were drafted by the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space. A fifth treaty, the Moon Agreement, was drafted by COPUOS in 1979, and since then the COPUOS has adopted “soft law” statements of principles, which are more aspirational than binding international law. Several states have implemented national space laws to govern the activities of their citizens in space. The development of space law has expanded into a wide range of issues but has lagged activities conducted at both the national and international levels. As such effective and comprehensive regulations of technical policy and law are lacking in several areas of endeavor. The participants in this plenary will identify and discuss emerging issues in space technical policy and law that are of critical importance for resolution.",
