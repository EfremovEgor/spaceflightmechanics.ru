		abstract:
			"Space dangers and threats are the reality of our world. Some of them  already manifested in practical life. Тhe problems of space debris, space weather, asteroid-comet hazard (ACH), the problem of dark and quiet skies have a global nature and are subject of international cooperation. Solving these problems is an essential and necessary component of the work to achieve sustainable development. These issues are regularly discussed both at scientific conferences and at the highest level, for example, at meetings of the UN Scientific and Technical Subcommittee. In this talk we discuss urgent issue of the ACH problem. This is essentially a problem of detection of decameter size Near Earth Asteroids (NEAs), which are the most dangerous on a practically significant time scale. The problem is very far from being solved. This requires the combined efforts of many countries. The report describes the progress and challenges of cooperation between the BRICS and other countries in creating a global effective network for the detection and warning of dangerous asteroids. To detect decameter size NEAs is necessary to regurarly perform a sufficiently deep survey of the entire celestial sphere on a scale of several hours. This requires a sufficiently dense and geographically evenly (globally) distributed network of observation stations. The BRICS approach to creating such a network, based on the BITDN/GOTTA initiative, is  discussed.",

		speaker: "Giancarlo Genta, Polytechnic University of Turin, Italy",
		abstract:
			"Since the first discovery of an exoplanet we realised that planets orbiting other stars are not just an assumption with little scientific ground – and a commonplace of science fiction – but a common occurrence. After more than 20 years we know that terrestrial planets are common and many lie within their star's habitable zone.  In the next years, we expect to start the process leading us to become a multi-planetary species, by first exploring and then colonising the Moon and Mars and other bodies of the solar system. We will launch precursor interstellar probes and likely also true interstellar robotic microprobes performing a fast flyby mission. All this requires just moderate and predictable technological advances and is a required step toward human interstellar exploration and colonisation. But to travel to the stars, and above all to their planetary systems, and to colonize exoplanets will ever be possible? Can we perform true interstellar human missions of the simplest type – either space arks or slow interstellar ships carrying a hibernated crew – in a predictable timeframe? In both cases a nuclear propulsion system – either an advanced fission or a fusion thruster is needed, and this does not require advances in basic science, but only the development of technologies already under study. The study concentrates on the design of what is usually referred to as a ‘slow boat’, i.e., an ark of small size travelling at a small percentage of the speed of light, to reach the extrasolar planet Proxima Centauri b in less than 450 years. The habitat – assumed to be similar to a space settlement of a relatively small size – and the thruster are mainly considered since these elements are believed to be the most critical ones to assess the feasibility of such an interstellar exploration and colonisation mission.",

			"Nowadays, more and more nations all over the world have, or plan to have, the capability to develop and launch spacecraft. International cooperation in space research and exploration has the potential to provide significant benefits to all participants. Benefits in the form of monetary efficiency, programmatic and political sustainability, and workforce stability will accrue to those partners who choose to approach space research and exploration as a mutually beneficial endeavor. Furthermore, international cooperation must be explicitly incorporated as an aspect, and goal, of a modern space research and exploration programs to enable coordination prior to the construction of new trends in space education. Such coordination can happen on both the industry, and university levels and allows for education and training the personnel. Outer space must become an arena for international cooperation for global sustainable development, and not a theatre for an arms race, as it began its consideration of international cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space. The greatest example of international cooperation approach is the International Space Station, which was supported by the Russia, United States, the European Space Agency, Canada, and Japan. The time makes correctives in the list of partners and the goals to achieve. The perspectives of partnership of BRICS and African countries have been proved for many years in different areas and the space international cooperation is not an exclusion here. It seems that it is necessary to formalize and develop to higher levels the international cooperation between countries of BRICS and Africa by creation new international organization – BRICS and Africa Space Research and Education Association. All research and education institution with space or other connected profiles of the countries of BRICS and Africa are invited to join this initiative of Russian Academy of Sciences and RUDN University named after Patrice Lumumba and agree on joint memorandum / declaration during in the frame of this session «BRICS and Africa International Space Research and Education Cooperation” regarding the necessity of creation BRICS and Africa Space Research and Education Association in order the initiative should be joint initiative of the participants of the session.",

		description:
			"Space technical policy and law at the international level originated in resolutions of general principles adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in the early 1960’s. These initial statements consisted of a handful of principles considered to be essential for the peaceful movement of mankind into outer space, including activities on the Moon and other celestial bodies. Within a few years these resolutions were incorporated and elaborated upon in the Outer Space Treaty of 1967, followed by the Rescue and Return Agreement, the Liability Convention, and the Registration Convention, all of which were drafted by the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space. A fifth treaty, the Moon Agreement, was drafted by COPUOS in 1979, and since then the COPUOS has adopted “soft law” statements of principles, which are more aspirational than binding international law. Several states have implemented national space laws to govern the activities of their citizens in space. The development of space law has expanded into a wide range of issues but has lagged activities conducted at both the national and international levels. As such effective and comprehensive regulations of technical policy and law are lacking in several areas of endeavor. The participants in this plenary will identify and discuss emerging issues in space technical policy and law that are of critical importance for resolution.",
